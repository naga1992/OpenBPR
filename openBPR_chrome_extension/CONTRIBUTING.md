#### Prerequsite

The extension uses WebSocket Protocol to connect to the server. The Server is started as soon as you Launch Spy/Heal/Recorder from the **Cognizant Intelligent Test Scripter**

So it is required that the server needs to be running to Test it .

By default the server runs on https://localhost:8887. The server runs with a self-signed certificate that needs to be installed. Check [Documentation]() for more info
